# Instructions:

## Install python:
 - Download and install python from the following link:
   https://www.python.org/downloads/
  
  In case typing 'python' to the command line after installing doesn't work, you should add python to PATH environment variable.

**Add python to PATH:**

 - Locate python executable and copy its path. (eg: 
C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python )
- Search 'edit environment variables' in the start menu and click the 'Environment Variables' tab in the pop up.
- Double click the 'path' entry in the 'User variables' section
- Paste the path to the executable in the new pop window.
- Do the same for the 'pip' executable. Usually it would be inside the Python>Scripts.
- Restart the system for the changes to be effective
